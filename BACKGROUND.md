# Background

## Project Inception
I saw some discussion on the Continous Delivery community Discord around how there are not enough moderately complex
practical examples of the 4-Layered Acceptance Test Architecture out there so I thought I try my own hand at one. I also
saw it as a good project to experiment with a more AI heavy coding workflow.

So since I had no good project idea for this myself one day I asked ChatGPT:

> Can you help me find a moderately complex little app idea which I can use to create a tutorial repository to
> demonstrate Acceptance Test Driven development techniques.....

to which it replied

> That’s a great idea! For a tutorial repository demonstrating **Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)**, you’ll
> want an app that:
> - Is **moderately complex** (enough to require clear business rules but not too large to become unwieldy).
> - Has **clear user stories** that define expected behavior before implementation.
> - Can be built iteratively with evolving test cases.
> - Can support both **UI-driven and API-driven** acceptance tests.
>
> ## **App Idea: "Task Bounty Board"**
> A **small web app where users can post and claim tasks with bounties**. The focus is on managing a backlog of tasks that need to be done, with an incentive structure.
>
> (some detailed list of potential features)

and as another experiment then I asked GPT in the same chat to provide me with a prompt for an AI Product Owner that
would guide my requirements - let's see how that goes.
